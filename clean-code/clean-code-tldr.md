# Clean Code
Clean code is code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. It follows a set of principles that are designed to make the code more readable, testable, and less error-prone. 

## principles:
- <b>Clarity:</b> easy to read and understand.
- <b>Simplicity:</b> simple, avoid complexity.
- <b>Comments:</b> Comments only necessary to explain complex code.
- <b>Naming:</b> Variables, functions, and classes should have meaningful and descriptive names.
- <b>Formatting:</b> consistently formatted, improve readability.
- <b>Functionality:</b> small, single-purpose functions and classes.
- <b>Error handling:</b> handle errors in a consistent and predictable way.
- <b>Testing:</b> testable, high test coverage.
- <b>Reusability:</b> reusable and modular.
- <b>Performance:</b> efficient and performant.

## application and examples:
- avoid unecessary nesting, use throw and return early (simplicity, error handling)
- be clear, avoid ambiguity (naming and meaning)
- consistency (formatting, naming)
- don't hardcode, use const
- don't update variables inside function, return it. (reusability, performance)
- single responsibility principles (simplicity, clarity, reusability, performance)
